# NES Pacman Hackrom


Actually *it is not* a real game. You can only move Pacman in 4 axis directions with **arrow keys** without any collision kind.

There is a ghost in bottom corner which goes left and right. It has left and right bounds (it would come back when it reaches a bound).

Work in Progress
